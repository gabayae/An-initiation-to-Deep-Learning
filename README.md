#  <h1 align="center">                   ` An Initiation to Deep Learning `       </h1>


This repo has been set up to show my journey through `Deep Learning`. It is meant to be used as a guide for a self-taught process. The different concepts will be discussed in a progessive manner, inorder to build necessary skills in the area.




## I. TensorFlow
`Google Colab`: An easy way to learn and use TensorFlow. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true) is probably your best 
friend when learning `TensorFlow`. No install necessaryâ€”run the [TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) directly in the browser with [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb), a Google research project created to help disseminate machine learning education and research. It's a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use and runs entirely in the cloud. [Read the blog post](https://medium.com/tensorflow/colab-an-easy-way-to-learn-and-use-tensorflow-d74d1686e309). I could not find better introduction to the topic that the material available [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide). I called it `The TensorFlow Notebooks`. At the beginning, it assumes a familiarity with [`Numpy`](https://numpy.org/) and really gives you the necessary to quick start with `TensorFlow` and `Keras`. I divided the work  in a series of notebooks (each to be completed daily, ideally) I deemed suitable for a **learner/beginner** who wants to learn in a progressive way. However, feel free to move faster if your learning rate requires so.


 ####  I.1-  [`Eager execution`](https://github.com/gabayae/An-initiation-to-Deep-Learning/blob/main/TensorFlow_1_EagerExecution.ipynb). Run the notebook locally by <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow_docs/docs/site/en/guide/eager.ipynb"><img src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/download_logo_32px.png" />downloading it</a> or even better [`run it in Colab`](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/guide/eager.ipynb)

 
 ####  I.2-  [`Introduction to Tensors`](https://github.com/gabayae/An-initiation-to-Deep-Learning/blob/main/TensorFlow_2_IntroductiontoTensors.ipynb). Run the notebook locally by <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow_docs/docs/site/en/guide/tensor.ipynb"><img src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/download_logo_32px.png" />downloading it</a> or even better [`run it in Colab`](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/guide/tensor.ipynb#scrollTo=AL2hzxorJiWy).
